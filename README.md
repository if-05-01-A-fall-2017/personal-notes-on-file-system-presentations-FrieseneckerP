# Notes of Friesenecker Pascal #

## Group: Kepplinger ##
### All in all good ideas ###
### They only didn't think about whats is if the conntent list is getting to big. ###

## Group: Jusic ##
### really good PowerPoint ###
### the linked list system is not good, because you need to go through all block to see the last one. ### 


## Group: Pfleger ##
### Best concept, i think they thought about what happens if a block getting to big. ###
### The seek() nice and smart. ###
### They have diffrent block types like content-, directory- and metadatablocks. ###

## Group: Fallmann ##
### same as Jusic they did a linked list system ###

## Group: Danninger ##
### and this was nearly like Kepplingers ###

## All Groups ##
### All saved the free blocks in a Free_Block_List.  ###
### If they need a new block they took it from the list and delete the adress from this list. ###
### If they delete stuff from a file or delete the whole file, they added the address of the freed blocks to the list. ###
### Every group excepted of Fallmann's and Jusic's saved the adress of a metadatablock, which contains metadata and a list of content blocks. ###
